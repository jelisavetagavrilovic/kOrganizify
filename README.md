## :memo: Application Description
**kOrganizify** is an extremely useful application that helps you efficiently organize your time and tasks. With ease, you can set plans, track events, and maintain a high level of productivity with reminders and calendars.

If you ever find yourself unsure of how to best schedule your commitments, the Planner will do it for you. Enter events and time ranges during the day when you want to complete them, and let SmartPlan organize your tasks and present you with all possible options.

When it comes to socializing with friends, the Planner makes arranging meetings easier. By sending a synchronization request to your friend, the app will automatically find available times for both of you and suggest suitable options. Once you find the ideal time that works for both you and your friend, the Planner will automatically add it to your calendar and your friend's calendar. All of this makes time organization and social activities simple and efficient.
